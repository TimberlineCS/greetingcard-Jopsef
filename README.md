## Overview

my program makes a greeting card that isn't super specific to any holiday in less than 200 lines of code

## Compiling and Using

## Discussion

The majority of problems that came up during the adventure of making this card were mostly just small issues of syntax and not knowing how to create what I want to. for the card i just compiled a bunch of random ideas and from there compiled it into a somewhat coherent image. I had to research most of this on my own and figure it out because Im not the best at learning these in class(paying attention). all errors i got were just syntax among other small issues. I googled the issue or asked chatgpt to fix it.the main part i found challenging was positioning everything where i wanted it. towards the end mostly everything clicked to where anytime i want to add something, i know exactly what i need to do.i would never change anything about this project, it is perfect. ill be able to apply not necessarily exactly what we did, but the concepts learned from this endeavor will always be used.

## Testing

In this section, tell us how you tested your project.

You are expected to test your projects before submitting them for
final review. Pretend that your instructor is your manager or 
customer at work. How would you ensure that you are delivering a 
working solution to their requirements?

I was testing this throughout the entire process of making it, every change I made was checked for bugs before moving on to the next, and then I did fixing later to make sure nothing clashed. I assure you, the only issue i can see occurring is certain objects not in the correct places because of differing resolutions.

## Extra Credit

If the project had opportunities for extra credit that you attempted,
be sure to call it out so the grader does not overlook it.
